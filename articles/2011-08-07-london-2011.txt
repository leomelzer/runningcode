title: London 2011
date: 07/08/2011

Sitting in the train back home (finally! after 4 months) and what to do? Maybe just writing down all the thoughts spinning through my head after a busy week in London. ~

A friend of mine had to catch a flight from LGW to ORD and wanted to spent some days in London before. Lucky I met a Londoner last year on Kecil Perhentian / Malaysia who we could crash with. We did no planning beforehand, as the end of the university term was bloody busy. But hey.

Our spontaenous itineary roughly ended up looking like this:
Monday:
# Late Arrival
Tuesday (sunny!):
# Renting Barclays Bikes
# Walking on the South Side of the Thames
# Being lazy in Green & Hyde Park
Wednesday (sunny!):
# Renting Barclays Bikes
# Borough Market
# Sushi followed by people-watching around Leicster Square
Thursday (rainy!):
# Tate Modern
# Tower of London
# Splashing out around Covent Garden at night
Friday (sunny, mostly): 
# Being just in time for a flight from London-Gatwick
# Borough Market, again
# Walking around Old Street
# Drinks at a Pub
Saturday (sunny but rather cool):
# Walking around Brick Lane
# Marocanian lunch
# Shopping
# Indian dinner
Sunday:
# Rushing to London-Luton, catching the flight back home.

I felt in need of some *real* holidays after these busy days in the end of July. Some days in a big city aren't really holidays but I enjoyed it really much.

We were lucky to be hosted by a friend which quite frankly is the best option to visit any place. You instantly feel connected and at home, get views normal tourists would never have and finally have someone to ask about the one or the other strange british thing.

London is expensive, but not as crazy expensive as it was several years ago. People use their credit cards for just about *everything* which felt a bit weird at first but got really convenient in the end. Now curious about my next bill...

Public transportation is great. We borrowed Oyster Cards and topped them up every now and then. Our host told us the system automatically charges the cheapest available option - if e.g. you travel quite a lot at one day you may be charged the price for a day-ticket if this is cheaper. The tube is one of the probably best known features of London and it worked well. The air-condition isn't as good as in the Skytrain / Bangkok (the best!) and most of the lines don't run at night but other than that, really good service. 
Another thing our host made us aware of are the Barclays Bikes. Rather new, hundreds of bike-stations were introduced by the Mayor of London with support by Barclay all around town. The charge is 1 Pound / 24 hours use plus usage-fees. The first 30 minutes are free, so if you can get to your destination in 30 minutes and return the bike in time you can get around London for 1 Pound for 24 hours - good deal, I'd say. Subscriptions with special keys are also available.
The system works with credit cards. The user-interface of the actual m is a bit counter-intuitive and could be vastly improved but the good prices and surprinsingly
